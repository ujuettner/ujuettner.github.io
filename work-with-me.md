## Areas of work that I’m interested in

* Software development
  * I'm absolutely convinced of [Golang](https://golang.org/), but I'd like to grow with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) or [Exlixir](https://elixir-lang.org/).
* Distributed systems
* Realtime stream processing & Big Data
* Internet of Things
* Infrastructure automation
* Linux

## Beliefs and values that guide my work

* Run what you develop - "you build it, you run it". Take ownership and responsibility for your code. I’ve always worked in roles that addressed both sides - software development and operations, and it feels to me like the right thing. My experience is that this requires small independent teams. Doing stuff twice in different teams is not as harmful as being stuck in coordination among many teams.
* Resilience and robustness. The systems we build are getting more and more complex. After having dealt with a lot of distributed systems resilience and robustness are crucial to me. A way to achieve this is loose coupling of systems. Automation enables minimization of manual, slow and error-prone work as well as infrastructure as code ("pet vs cattle", "no snowflakes"). This mitigates the easy problems leaving the hard problems to be solved by human experience and creativity.
* Willing to learn & share. The whole life is a journey - you meet a lot of people and get into many situations from which to learn. I’m grateful for every company, every team and every coworker I was working with in my professional career. There is a lot I learned in each and every role and from each and every person making me the person I am now. Hopefully, I’m able to share my experience with others and let them participate.

## The working environment that I like

* Values I can identify with: I’m heavily influenced by the [Amazon Leadership Principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles).
* Authentic & honest leadership: Live what you preach and be accountable.
* Respect & trust: Value others whether one agrees with you or not, and trust that we are all doing our best to succeed.
* Accept that we are all individuals: What works for one person might not work for others.
* Freedom to make decisions and to evolve creativity.
* A learning culture: Strive for continuous improvement and learn from failures.
* Agile methodologies: Whether it’s Scrum or Kanban, both work for me.
