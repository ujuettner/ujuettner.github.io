Dear recruiter,

you want to offer me a job?

Actually, I'm quite happy with my current job. Nevertheless, I'm always open to interesting and convincing opportunities. I love to grow and to learn new stuff and strive for continuous improvement.

So, if you can convince me that the job offered is a real improvement, I'm willing to learn more about it.

To convince me I need more information about the job and the company:
* The *boring* facts: job description, required skills, location, salary etc.
* What makes the offered job special or unique? E.g., this can be a certain key technology.
* The company name. I know that many recruiters don't want to disclose their client, but **how should I assess whether the company is compatible with my beliefs and values?** See [Work With Me](/work-with-me/) for my beliefs and values.
* What makes the company unique? What's their vision and the reason of their existence? How does the offered job contribute to that vision?
* How do they address their social responsibility? What do they think they are making this world a better place?
* How do they deal with changes and new challenges?
* How do they take care of their employees?
